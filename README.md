Guardian is an extensible AntiCheat for Sponge that gives you the flexibility to customize the checks to fit your servers needs.
Guardian also provides a service for [Precogs](https://ore.spongepowered.org/me4502/Precogs) to reduce plugin conflicts with those
who integrate with the lightweight service.

The plugin is a work in progress and there are plans for more detections to be added. Make sure to come chat with us on the
[Guardian Discord](https://discord.gg/pvSFtMm) or the [IchorPowered Discord](https://discord.gg/NzfKazX).

It is recommended that you use it with Guardian to improve accuracy. Some detections may also require it to work.
